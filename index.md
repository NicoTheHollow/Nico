Hello i'm nico i'm a chill dude and wont mind a chat or help whit personal stuff. Life has been a pain but
You should never give up on it or your just wasting a gift your parents gave you. Everyones special and no one must 
not love you for being special no matter what, I support you if your struggling whit something and this short paragraph or something
is my letter to dose who think its all meaningless. Never give up and just keep looking around the corner till you find what your looking for.
